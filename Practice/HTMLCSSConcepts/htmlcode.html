  absolute sizing -> it has fixed size or length example: 1cm it has equal length in every device like mobile, computer, tv etc.
  relative sizing -> We can change the size or length example: Assume that parent ha 100px, we are creating a child and we are giving child 50% then it will take 50% of length from parent -->
