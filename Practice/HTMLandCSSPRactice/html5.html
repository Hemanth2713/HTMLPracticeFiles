<!-- what is size units
  absolute sizing -> it has fixed size or length example: 1cm it has equal length in every device like mobile, computer, tv etc.
  relative sizing -> We can change the size or length example: Assume that parent ha 100px, we are creating a child and we are giving child 50% then it will take 50% of length from parent -->

      Welcome to CodeHelp!
  <!--  Here the Welcome to CodeHelp! size increased to 100px, because container123 as parent and  bpx 123 as child,
      container width is 10px and box width is 10em, the logic of 10 em is 10*parent size so thats why it is showing as 100px
      by default 1em =10px if we not specify any font size value.  -->
