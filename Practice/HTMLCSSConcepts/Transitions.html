    <!-- /* Definition of Transition:
   - A transition allows smooth animation between CSS property changes over a specified duration.

   Available Transition Properties:
   - transition-property: Defines which CSS property will undergo a transition.
   - transition-duration: Specifies the time (in seconds or milliseconds) the transition takes.
   - transition-timing-function: Controls the acceleration and deceleration of the transition.
   - transition-delay: Sets a waiting period before the transition starts.
   - transition: A shorthand property to define all transition settings in one declaration.
   - inherit: Takes the transition settings from its parent element.
   - initial: Resets the transition property to its default value (none).
   - unset: Removes any transition applied, acting as either inherit or initial.

   Shorthand Notation Format:
   - transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;

   Example:
   - transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out 0.2s;
